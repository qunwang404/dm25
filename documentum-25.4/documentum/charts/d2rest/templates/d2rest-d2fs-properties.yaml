    #       Temp files management       #
    #####################################

    # From version 25.2 onwards the temporary files are tracked using .json file considered as temp storage file.
    # Tracker file located in the appserver temp directory and file name is in following syntax FileTrackerStore_<App name>.json when initialized by default from appserver or FileTrackerStore.json when not initialized in case of custom logic.
    #
    # The D2FileCleaningTracker is to manage and track temporary files generated within an application. The primary objective of this tracker is to monitor, store, and clean up temporary files based on specific parameters to optimize disk usage. The tracker maintains a record of each temporary file in a JSON file stored at a designated application directory and periodically removes files that meet specified cleanup criteria.
    # Maintains its temporary file record information in two types: one type is \u2018hold\u2019, and another type is 'remove'.
    # The 'hold' type of temporary records will only be deleted when an application server restarts.
    # The 'remove' type of temporary records will delete on every D2FileCleaningTracker job run. And all the provided cleanup configuration parameters are only applicable for the remove type of temporary records.
    # The cleanup process is triggerred when "remove" type temporary records counts are more than maxTempFiles or records file size exceeds maxTempSizeMB or enableTimeBasedCleanup and deletes every "remove" type temporary file whose creation time is more than timeToLive minutes.
    #
    # Each file record will have the following structure:
    #
    #"<file path as key>":
    #  {
    #    "filename": "string",          // Name of the file and along with path
    #    "creationTime": number,       // Timestamp as number when temp file added to FileCleanTracker in milliseconds
    #    "size": number,               // File size in bytes
    #    "type": "string",           // "hold" or "remove"
    #    "priority": number,          // File priority to clean up faster
    #    "timeToLive": number          // Minutes after creationTime file duration to live safe
    #  }

    # This option controls whether an application operates in a time zone aware mode or not.
    # When this flag is set to true, the Smart View adjusts its behavior to handle time zones, and when presenting date-time to users within Smart View,
    # it converts the stored time to the client's local time zone before displaying it.
    # This conversion ensures that users see date and time adjusted according to their local time zone settings.
    # This setting affects any part of the application where dates or times are displayed or inputted.
    # For instance, on properties screens the displayed and input value values will reflect according to this configuration.
    # When set to false, Smart View client loaded in a browser will ignore local time zone, and show date-time values in server's time zone.
    # If not configured, the default value is true for Smart View.
