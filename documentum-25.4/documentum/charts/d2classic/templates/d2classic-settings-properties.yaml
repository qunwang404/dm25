    #
    # NOTE - CTF mode is DEPRECATED starting with the D2 16.7 release. It can still be used but is intended to
    #        be replaced by WSCTF mode. The details related to the CTF MODE can be read from the DEPRECATED_CTF_MODE

    ######################################################################################################################
    # The HTTP Content-Security-Policy response header allows website administrators to control resources the user agent
    # is allowed to load for a given page.
    # The HTTP Content-Security-Policy response header emitted by D2 can be controlled via the below setting.
    # The HTTP Content-Security-Policy is emitted for all browsers except IE. Please note that the support for IE is dropped.

    # The syntax for the header is below
    #       Content-Security-Policy: <policy-directive>; <policy-directive>

    # where <policy-directive> consists of: <directive> <value> with no internal punctuation.
    # There can be multiple types of directive and the directive to be used in production will depend upon the
    # organization's business requirements.
    # More details can be found at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy

    # To enable emitting of HTTP Content-Security-Policy response header, uncomment the below setting
    # and provide appropriate <policy-directive> as the value of the setting. The exact value will be returned as value of
    # the response header.

    # **** UN-COMMENT Below csp.header.value line ****

    # If the csp.header.value is not uncommented, then the emitted response header is:
    #   Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'

    #### Support for clickjacking defense can be provided via below <policy-directive>.
    # 1. frame-ancestors 'none'
    # 2. frame-ancestors 'self' # Refers to the origin from which the protected document is being served
    # 3. frame-ancestors https://host.acme1.com https://host.acme2.com/some/path https://*.acme3.com *.acme4.com

    # If the 3rd option above is used then it specifies valid parents that may embed or load D2 using <frame>, <iframe>,
    # <object>, or <embed>

    #### A few other examples of <policy-directive> are below
    # Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' data:
    # Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' data:
    #
    # Please note that some <policy-directives> may not work as-is and may interfere with the functioning of the product.
    # So,the admins should thoroughly test the product after uncommenting and specifying the desired value for csp.header.value
